<br><br><b> How did you decide on the specific role and company you wanted to apply for?




</b>
<br><br>
I was trying for a Software developer role and decided to try for Microsoft due to the work life balance
</b><br><br>

 <b>Was the domain you applied for during placements the same as the one you interned in during your third-year?  If not, why so

</b>
<br><br>
The profile was same, I interned as software developer at franklin Templeton and Quadeye

<br><br>
<b> What were the shortlisting criteria for the company?

</b>
   <br> <br>  For Microsoft we had an online assessment and then interviews on day 1, I had two technical interviews where they asked about past projects/internships and asked basic dsa/cp questions, One was online and one in Person. I didn't prepare specifically for Microsoft interviews but just prepared for the cs topics 
   <br><br><b>How many students were there initially who applied or got shortlisted? 

   </b>
   <br><br>
   Not sure about the shortlisting criteria but most candidates were shortlisted.  
   <br><br><b>
    What were the different rounds?

   </b>
   <br><br>

   1st round was online, He asked me about the past internships and then a simple dp question as to find number of ways to go from one end of grid to the other, next was an in person interview in which he again asked for past projects and then a basic question to compare two version codes (eg 2.5.4 and 1.4.5)
   <br><br><b>
    Are there any set of repetitive que or cases that you noticed especially in HR or GD?
   </b>
   <br><br>I didn't find any questions to be out of the ordinary, they were pretty standard about what you did or what you used to complete the project
   <br><br><b>
    ow did you prepare for each round?
   </b>
   <br><br> To prepare I just revised the CS topics 
   <br><br><b>
    Are there any resources or tips that you would like to share?
   </b>
   <br><br>Leetcode will be a good resource for the CP questions and having a good understanding of all the projects on the resume is a must.
<br><br><b>
    If you have had to do your prep all over again, what changes would you do?
   </b>
   <br><br> I would start the prep earlier and keep the work load in the semester minimal.
   <br><br><b>
    What is your current exact role in the company, if we ask about a typical day in your life as the employee?
   </b>
   <br><br> I am a software developer at Microsoft, working on the word, powerpoint, Excel mobile applications, I am part of the team tasked with improving the applicationsÂ performance
