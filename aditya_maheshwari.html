<br><br><b> How did you decide on the role and company?


</b>
<br><br>
I filled 80+ JAFs but focused on VC and Quant roles. Consulting was my backup, but after interning at BCG, I knew it wasn’t for me. My interest in VC came from E-Cell and a two-month internship at Unicorn India Ventures, which gave me valuable insights into the field<br><br><b>  Was the domain you applied for during placements the same as the one you interned in during your third year? If not, why so?
</b><br><br>

 <b>Was your placement domain the same as your internship?

</b>
<br><br>
Not really. My internship options were limited to consulting, finance, and software. During placements, the variety was much better. I applied broadly based on the opportunities available, not necessarily my preference.
<br><br>
<b> How was the selection process, and how did you prepare?

</b>
<br><br> 
There was a dinner followed by 6-7 buddy rounds. I prepared by understanding the VC ecosystem, reading about startups, and building a framework to evaluate them. Following startup news and case studies also helped.

 <br><br> <b>What were the shortlisting criteria?

    Candidates needed a CPI of 7.5+ and experience in consulting, VC, or startups. Only 20 were shortlisted
</b>
<br><br>
<b> What were the interview rounds like?

</b>
   <br> <br>  Each buddy round focused on analyzing startup cases. The discussions were detailed but repetitive, helping refine my thought process.
   <br><br><b>
    Any repetitive HR questions?

   </b>
   <br><br>
   I didn’t face HR rounds, but common questions include: ‘Why this company?’ and ‘Why VC over consulting?  
   <br><br><b> Tips or resources for preparation?
   </b>
   <br><br>Stay updated with startup and financial news.
   Build your own framework for evaluating startups.
   Practice consulting cases to develop structured thinking.
   Use resources like Junior VC for simple explanations.
   
   <br><br><b> What would you do differently?
   </b>
   <br><br>
   Nothing, honestly. While only 20% of the prep directly helped, the rest built a strong foundation. It’s subjective, so focus on learning
   <br><br><b>
    What’s your current role like?
   </b>
   <br><br>I evaluate healthcare and health tech startups, analyzing their numbers, strategies, and overall potential. It’s all about finding interesting investment opportunities.
<br><br><b>
    Final advice for final-year students:
   </b>
   <br><br>Figure out your interests—it matters.
   Don’t follow the crowd blindly.
   Campus placements aren’t the only option; apply externally if needed.
