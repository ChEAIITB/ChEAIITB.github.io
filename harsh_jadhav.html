                    <p>I am Harsh Jadhav, a third-year undergraduate student in the Department of Chemical Engineering. Born and brought up in Mumbai, I enjoy outdoor and fitness-oriented activities such as trekking, swimming, and running marathons.

                        <p>
<b> What was your motivation for the internship and what was the recruitment process like? Why did you chose to do an internship instead of other options, such as projects or bootcamp? How did you prep for this role?

</b><br>
Motivation for the Internship
My interest in Chemical Engineering was sparked early on during a two-week vocational training program in the summer of 2024 at an ammonium bicarbonate manufacturing plant. Although my theoretical knowledge was limited at that stage, witnessing large-scale continuous operations firsthand left a strong impression on me and helped me appreciate the elegance and real-world impact of chemical engineering. This experience motivated me to seek further industrial exposure.
Chemical Engineering is a vast and diverse field, and by the end of my fourth semester, I realized that I wanted to utilize my second-year summer break to explore potential career paths before narrowing down. I was particularly interested in gaining exposure to the pharmaceutical and oil & gas sectors. Like everyone else, I did not want to let the summer pass without any meaningful learning.
Why an Internship over Projects
I chose to pursue an internship over a purely academic project because I wanted to gain some hands-on industrial experience. I wanted to understand how concepts taught in classrooms translate to real manufacturing environments, especially in regulated and quality-driven industries like pharmaceuticals. Interestingly, while my primary goal was practical exposure, I also ended up contributing to research-oriented work during the internship, which gave me a balanced experience of both industry and applied research.

    <b>Did you get this internship via apping? If yes, highlight the apping process.
</b><br>
    No

   <!-- <br>  During my internship, I worked on designing heat exchangers and batch distillation columns, selecting a suitable coolant for an exothermic reaction, and researching on ways to minimize solvent wastage through Literature Review. I also visited many plants and learned about various equipment. -->

       Can you explain your role in the internship? What jobs were you expected to perform and what projects were you involved with?

  </b><br>
  Role and Responsibilities during the Internship
During my internship, I worked in a Solid-State Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) laboratory, where peptide manufacturing was carried out as a batch process. The facility was a recently acquired plant, and operations were largely chemistry-driven, with limited application of Chemical Engineering principles such as real-time process monitoring and optimization. Notably, the plant did not have online analyzers and relied heavily on Batch Manufacturing Records (BMRs) to decide reaction endpoints, without direct insight into the completion of individual reaction steps.
My primary responsibility was to  evaluate the feasibility and value of implementing a Process Analytical Technology (PAT) system that the company was considering procuring from a third-party vendor.
To achieve this, my role involved:
Developing a strong understanding of peptide chemistry, solid-phase synthesis steps, and the underlying reaction mechanisms
Interacting with the PAT vendor to understand the working principles, capabilities, and limitations of the proposed analytical tool
Designing experiments to assess how effectively the PAT could monitor reaction progress and detect endpoints in real time
Analyzing data to identify inefficiencies rising from the lack of real-time process monitoring
Through this study, I was able to demonstrate that the absence of an online PAT system was leading to extended reaction times, over-processing, and material losses, cumulatively resulting in an estimated financial loss of approximately 2 million per year. My findings provided a strong techno-economic justification for adopting PAT, enabling more informed decision-making as well as improved process efficiency

        What were the most exciting aspects of the internship? What were the most challenging aspects?
</b><br>
    The most exciting part of the internship was gaining firsthand exposure to the pharmaceutical industry and understanding how GMP governs manufacturing, documentation, and quality control. It also provided valuable insight into a corporate work environment. While working on batch peptide synthesis, I realized that I find continuous processes more engaging due to their potential for real-time monitoring, process optimization, advanced technologies, and innovative instrumentation.
The most challenging aspect was working long hours in the laboratory while wearing full PPE, which demanded physical endurance and constant focus. However, this experience helped me develop the discipline and resilience required in regulated industrial settings.

    <b>
        What was the culture like in your office? How did the company treat the interns and what were you provided with?

    </b><br>
   
Work Culture and Intern Experience
The work culture was professional and GMP-driven (or was it?), with six working days, six-hour shifts, and strict laboratory discipline. As an intern, I felt well-supported: my project guide, Pradip Mali, was encouraging, and since I already knew Manas Agrawal, a 2025 IIT graduate, it was easy to seek guidance. Overall, interns were entrusted with meaningful responsibilities in a structured learning environment.
<p>
    <b>
         What were your key learnings from the internship and any tips you would like to give to your juniors?
<br> </b>
  One key learning from the internship was the importance of interpersonal and communication skills in an industrial setting, as effective coordination with chemists and operators was essential to get my work done smoothly.
For juniors aiming for core Chemical Engineering roles, I strongly recommend pursuing an industrial internship, as projects can be done during the semester, but internships offer invaluable exposure to real-world operations and work culture.
