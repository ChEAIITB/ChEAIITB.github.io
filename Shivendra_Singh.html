                        <p>Why did you choose this company and role?

I decided to apply for a role at Reliance Industries due to its reputation as a leader in the oil and gas industry, offering immense opportunities for chemical engineers to engage with large-scale and complex chemical processes. The company's scale and the diversity of projects it undertakes provide a unique learning environment, making it a perfect place to gain hands-on experience in the core chemical engineering field. The prospect of working on high-impact projects in a respected organization with global recognition strongly appealed to me.

During placements, I shifted my focus from analytics, which was the domain of my third-year internship, to core chemical engineering. The internship had allowed me to explore data-driven problem-solving, but my passion for chemical engineering led me to pursue a role that aligned more closely with my academic background. However, I was able to integrate my analytical skills into my approach to process optimization and decision-making within the chemical industry, blending both my interests.

Pre-placement talks played a crucial role in helping me understand the company's expectations and work culture. These sessions offered insight into job roles and skills that companies prioritize. I found attending these talks beneficial and would highly recommend them to anyone aiming to align their career path with a company's values and long-term vision.

How did the selection process unfold, and how did you prepare for it?

The selection process began with two tests: one focusing on core chemical engineering concepts like thermodynamics, heat transfer, and fluid mechanics, and the other assessing aptitude through quantitative reasoning and logical problem-solving. Once the tests were completed, successful candidates moved to technical interviews where chemical engineering knowledge and practical experience were explored. The process concluded with an HR interview to evaluate communication skills, cultural fit, and career goals.

To prepare, I used a combination of online resources and reference books to refresh my understanding of key chemical engineering concepts. For the interviews, I structured my resume thoroughly, ensuring that each point could be backed by specific examples and experiences. I reviewed my internships and final year projects in-depth, preparing to discuss technical applications confidently. For the HR interview, I focused on common questions, crafting responses that highlighted leadership, teamwork, and adaptability. Practicing communication skills was essential in delivering clear and concise answers.

What were the key challenges and common interview questions?

The selection stages included an aptitude test, followed by two rounds of interviews. The technical interview focused on core chemical engineering principles, including mass and heat transfer, unit operations, and process design. Practical discussions centered around my internships and project work. The HR interview revolved around typical questions like "Tell me about yourself" and "Why Reliance?", where I had to demonstrate my alignment with the company’s goals and values.

What are your takeaways and advice for future candidates?

In terms of resources, I didn’t rely on one specific source but instead used a variety of materials to cover core topics comprehensively. Keeping a resilient mindset and learning from setbacks was also critical. The placement process can be stressful, but staying consistent, seeking feedback, and continuously improving are key strategies for success.

If I had to prepare again, I would start earlier, particularly with technical concepts, to ensure a broader understanding. Mock interviews and refining HR responses would also help build confidence.

In conclusion, my biggest learning from the placement process was the importance of understanding core concepts thoroughly. My advice to fourth-year students is to stay focused, seek guidance from seniors, and adapt their preparation strategies based on the companies they are targeting. Best of luck! </p>
                        <p><b>How crucial were the pre-placement talks and would you recommend attending them?</b><br>
                            The pre-placement talk (PPTs) were mostly focused on company branding and weren’t highly relevant. However, since the placement season can be unpredictable, these talks can still be helpful as they provide some direction.

                        <p><b>	How was the shortlisting process ?</b>
                            The selection process typically involves an initial test and resume screening. Companies had specific CPI criteria and would shortlist students based on their CPI, relevant keywords in their resumes, or involvement in particular clubs.</p>

                                <b>Are there any set of repetitive que or cases that you noticed especially in HR or GD? </b><br>
The cases given during interviews were quite specific and not repetitive. However, in the HR round, the focus was primarily on introductions and resume screening.

                                <b>How did you prepare for each round? </b><br>
For tech preparation, I focused on DSA, some theory, and Machine Learning. For the HR round, I used a book with 64 common HR questions but only went through the first 15-20 pages. You don’t need to dive deep—going through 10-20 questions gives a good idea and helps you navigate the interview. For consulting prep, I practiced cases from books, and for product roles, I found the new books in the market less relevant. Watching a few YouTube videos was more helpful for that.

                                <b>If you have had to do your prep all over again, what changes would you do?</b><br>
I don’t think I would have changed much in my preparation—what I did was enough. I just wish I had been more confident and reassured myself that I would get placed, even if it took some time. I should have stayed more positive, knowing that something would eventually work out and I would secure a placement.

                            <p><b>	Key learnings from the process and a final note for fourthies.</b><br>
                                A key learning I’d share with all final-year students is to be more patient. The shortlisting process can feel very random—sometimes people who may not seem deserving get placed. But in the end, you need to have confidence and patience, trusting that you will get placed. Just keep trying every day, and things will eventually work out.
