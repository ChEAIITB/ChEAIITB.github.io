<br><br><b> How did you decide on the specific role and company you wanted to apply for?




</b>
<br><br>
I have always had a keen interest in software roles, particularly where they intersect with the finance industry, which is where I have accumulated significant experience. As I explored job opportunities, I concentrated on companies that aligned with my passions and skill set. Among those, FinMechanics stood out as a leading contender. The unique combination of innovative work and projects that FinMechanics offers particularly resonates with my interests, making it my top choice for pursuing my career aspirations in this dynamic field.

 <b>Was the domain you applied for during placements the same as the one you interned in during your third-year?  If not, why so

</b>
<br><br>
Yes, the the domain was same that I applied for during placenments.
<br><br>
<b> What were the shortlisting criteria for the company?

</b>
   <br> <br>  The process had 3 steps:<br><br>
   1.	Test Shortlisting Criteria: In the initial phase, candidates who have a respectable Cumulative Performance Index (CPI) along with a strong resume are primarily selected for the test. It's essential that applicants showcase both academic excellence and relevant experiences to increase their chances of being shortlisted.
   <br><br>2.	Interview Shortlisting Overview: During the test, it's crucial to approach the questions strategically, as the test includes negative marking, which can impact your overall score. To secure a place on the interview shortlist, aim to score above the median score roughly 40%. A higher score will significantly enhance your prospects of being invited for an interview.
  <br><br> 3.	Round 2 Interview Shortlisting: You need to perform well during round 1 which mostly revolves around understanding what you have done in the past and how comfortable you are in tech, finance and consult, if you are decent enough in those or exceptional in any one then congrats you are through to round 2. In the second round you can expect gauging on the basis of the position requirement mostly questions are HR types but tech and finance can be involved again, resume can be grilled and also don’t shy away from accepting what you don’t know and what you know.
   <br><br><b>How many students were there initially who applied or got shortlisted? 

   </b>
   <br><br>
   1.	Total Applicants: Approximately 500 students applied for the position, out of which 300 were shortlisted for test<br>
   2.	Test Shortlist: Out of these, around 100 were shortlisted for interview<br>
   3.	Interview Round 1 (R1): around 15 were shortlisted for round 2 interview<br>
   4.	Interview Round 2 (R2): after round 2, TWO selections were made

   <br><br><b>
    What is your current exact role in the company?


   </b>
   <br><br>In my current role, the work primarily revolves around building tech solutions or developing modules for finance-related tasks. Additionally, there is significant interaction with clients to gather and understand their requirements, which shapes the deliverables.
   <br><br><b>
    How is like a typical day in your life as the employee?


   </b>
   <br><br>The workday usually starts around 10-11 a.m., and you stay until your goals for the day are completed. The workplace environment is lively, with many young colleagues, mostly IIT graduates, which makes it enjoyable and engaging. However, the workload can become hectic at times, especially when there are urgent client requirements to address.

    Key learnings from the process and a final note for fourth-year students.



   </b>
   <br><br> This phase has been one of the most challenging yet memorable experiences since college. The interview preparation and selection process is something you’ll always remember, so it’s important to enjoy the journey. Opportunities like these don’t come often, so treat every interview as a golden chance to get selected for your dream company. Give it your all, take care of yourself by getting proper sleep and meals, and maintain a focused and calm state of mind, as that is crucial for performing your best. <br>
