        <h3>Prashabdhi Athawale | Hindustan Unilever Limited</h3>
        <img src="prash0_25.jpg" alt="Anushka Khowala">
        <p>Heyy all! I’m Prashabdhi, a fourth-year undergraduate from the Chemical Engineering department at IIT Bombay. I recently completed an 8-week internship at Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) as a Supply Chain Intern under the Unilever Leadership Internship Program (ULIP).  You’ve probably heard of (and used) brands like Taj Mahal Tea, Bru Coffee, Vaseline . Yes, HUL is the FMCG giant behind these household names.  So, why did I choose to intern in the FMCG sector? If you're currently debating which domain to explore or whether FMCG is the right fit for you, you're not alone, I had the same questions. In this blog, I’ll take you through my entire journey: from the application and interview process all the way to what it was actually like working at HUL.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="blog-section">
        <p  class="pare"><span class="q">Q:</span>What was your motivation for the internship and what was the recruitment process like?</p>
        <p>So like any other third-year student, I started off by making 3–4 different versions of my resume, tailored for profiles like Product Management, Supply Chain (FMCG), and a few others. At that point, I wasn’t targeting any specific domain.

For preparation, I focused on general HR questions, reviewed my resume thoroughly (multiple times!), and gave mock interviews with friends. After getting shortlisted for HUL, I immediately reached out to seniors to understand the next rounds of the process.

There were two rounds: one HireVue video interview, and one final HR interview.

In the HireVue round, you’re asked a set of questions which appear on the screen, you get 2–3 minutes to prepare, and then you have to record your answer. The questions can range from personality-based to domain-specific. In my case, I was asked something related to the Supply Chain domain. Once you submit your responses, they’re reviewed by the company, and then a final shortlist is released for the interview round.

The final interview, in my experience, was pretty chill. It lasted about 30 minutes and was more of a conversation than a typical grilling session. We spoke about my resume, my interests, and why I was excited to work at HUL. They didn’t ask anything too core-chemical specific, but I’d still suggest being ready with 1–2 topics from your core field just in case. Some interviewers do like to go there.

The interview isn’t meant to trap you - it’s more of a discussion to understand if you're a good fit for the role, which demands accountability, ownership, leadership, and a quick grasp of the company and its functioning.

For the interview, my prep mainly involved going through my resume in depth - every project, internship, and POR I had listed. I also made sure to check out the company’s website and understand their values, especially things like leadership, sustainability, and purpose-driven growth.

If you’ve done all this, you’re good to go.

        <p class="pare"><span class="q">Q:</span> Can you explain your role in the internship? What jobs were you expected to perform and what projects were you involved with?</p>
        <p>I worked in the Supply Chain domain, and my project revolved around energy reduction, cost optimization, and CO2 emission reduction - essentially contributing to HUL’s broader sustainability goals.

Each intern is assigned a tutor, buddy, and coach, with the tutor being your main point of contact throughout the internship. In some cases, you might need to reach out to your tutor before the internship begins to understand your project charter, which is usually shared about a week in advance.

The internship kicked off with all of us ULIPs bonding over our shared struggles with Mumbai locals. We stayed at the Courtyard Marriott in Andheri for two days of induction. After that, everyone moved to their respective stint locations. Since my posting was at the Mumbai Head Office, I was allotted a guesthouse in Wadala along with other co-interns.

After the first day of induction, you get to meet your tutor if they are based in the same Mumbai Head office. The first two weeks are mostly about understanding your project scope, identifying the key stakeholders, and creating a roadmap for execution. HUL really encourages you to think creatively, challenge existing systems, and come up with innovative solutions. The work culture also promotes open communication, so reaching out to anyone, regardless of hierarchy, is welcomed.

Being at the Head Office, I often used Microsoft Teams and Outlook to connect with people at various factories and understand the finer details of my project from them.

After four weeks, we had a mid-review with our tutors, coaches, and the tutors’ managers. The aim was to assess how well we understood our project, how deeply we had explored the related concepts, and what our plan was for completing it.

I was handling three projects simultaneously, which was, not going to lie, a bit hectic, but also incredibly rewarding. I got to explore a wide range of topics and gained diverse insights. I also had the opportunity to visit two factories in Amli and Dapada, and honestly, I had the best time there!

My main stakeholders were factory engineers and utility executives, but for one of my projects, I also worked with external stakeholders like TCS, Thermax, Cotopaxi etc. I even visited Thermax to understand their operations better, which added another dimension to my learning.

By the seventh week, you’re expected to wrap up your projects and prepare for your final presentation. This is where you present your work to your tutor and other stakeholders. Based on this presentation and overall performance, they decide whether to offer you a Pre Placement Interview (PPI).

After that, if you’re selected, there are two rounds of interviews - the first with General Managers of the Supply Chain team, and the second with the Executive Director of Supply Chain. Based on these rounds, the Pre Placement Offers (PPOs) are rolled out. These final rounds are quite selective and are used to filter out candidates.

        <p class="pare"><span class="q">Q:</span> What were the most exciting aspects of the internship? What were the most challenging aspects?</p>
        <p>One of the things I was most excited about was diving into the world of corporate jargon and systems - understanding how a large company like HUL operates from the inside.

But what truly made the experience memorable were the bonds I built with my co-interns. We shared our roadblocks, gave each other updates, and basically lived together for those 8 weeks. From debating over what to eat in the company cafeteria while sticking to our budgets, to taking cabs in the morning and catching locals in the evening to save money (and escape traffic), these small moments became some of my favorite memories from the internship.

When it came to the project itself, the excitement grew as it gradually unfolded. In the first week, things might feel a bit fuzzy since you’re still getting used to the environment, the terminologies, and figuring out the exact scope of your project. But as time passes, everything starts falling into place. You begin to understand what you’re really working on, who your key stakeholders are, where you might need to travel, and how you’ll eventually conclude your project.

Your tutor plays a crucial role throughout. They guide you not just on the project direction, but also on how to approach problems, what frameworks to use, and how to structure your solutions better. You’re also assigned a coach, you typically meet them two or three times during the internship. But those conversations can be incredibly eye-opening. For me, every meeting with my coach gave me a completely new perspective and pushed me to refine my thinking. It helped me unlock deeper layers of the problem and explore more innovative directions.

One thing you should be prepared for: your project goals or deliverables may change midway through the internship. And that’s okay. By then, you’ll already have built a strong foundation, and adapting becomes part of the learning process. HUL really encourages this kind of flexible and solution-driven thinking. It’s about how you continue to communicate, re-evaluate, and align with your stakeholders.

In just eight weeks, you’re expected to understand your project, interact with diverse stakeholders, develop solutions, and deliver outcomes. It’s a lot - but it’s also incredibly rewarding. I personally got to apply some core chemical engineering concepts, while also learning about energy efficiency, sustainability practices, and managerial decision-making. It was a perfect blend of my technical background and managerial exposure, and I could see how much the company values accountability, ownership, and initiative.

Of course, no internship is without its challenges. Since I was based in the Mumbai Head Office, but my project was deeply factory-oriented, one major roadblock was coordinating with factory personnel - they’re extremely busy, and it’s tough to get hold of them. But with consistent follow-ups and clear communication, I eventually built strong working relationships.

Another challenge some interns might face is that tutors can be very busy too. That’s where your own drive to learn comes in. How consistent you are, how proactive you are in communicating, and how eager you are to grow, all of that plays a huge role in making the most out of this internship.

Even though the official timings were from 9 to 5, many of us in the Head Office stayed back until 7 or even 8 in the evening because that’s when stakeholders were finally free. But in the end, all those extra hours, challenges, and roadblocks were absolutely worth it. I walked away with a deeper understanding of the company, its people, and its purpose and a lot of personal growth along the way.

      <div class="blog-section">
        <p class="pare"><span class="q">Q:</span> What was the culture like in your office? How did the company treat the interns and what were you provided with?
</p>
        <p>Since I was based at the Mumbai Head Office, I spent most of my time on the Supply Chain floor and let me tell you, it’s a seriously high-energy space. The people there are constantly busy, working from around 9 AM to 6 PM, often juggling multiple tasks, coordinating not only within the office but also with 27 different factories across the country. It was in this fast-paced environment that I truly understood how demanding and critical supply chain operations are. Supply chain is the heartbeat of factory operations, and witnessing that first-hand was eye-opening.

As an intern though, I never felt like I was out of place. In fact, everyone was incredibly welcoming. The moment you introduce yourself as a ULIP intern, people are very kind to help. They’re genuinely interested in your project, and will guide you on whom to reach out to- whether it’s a senior in a factory, someone from your own college, or another stakeholder in the company. 

My tutor and other stakeholders were extremely supportive. They shared all the data, materials, and context I needed to make progress. Any time I was stuck, I never hesitated to reach out - and I always got help.

One of the most wholesome things about the Mumbai office is this little tradition that everyone follows - post-lunch walks. The head office is designed like a modern open mall, with wide hallways, natural light, and little brand stalls like Bru Coffee and Magnum Ice Creams. After lunch, teams casually go for a walk around the building, usually four to five rounds and then head back to work. 

These small rituals made us interns feel like we were part of something bigger. We weren’t just visitors for eight weeks, we were immersed in the culture, and that made the experience all the more fulfilling.
</p>
        <p class="pare"><span class="q">Q:</span> What were your key learnings from the internship?
</p>
        <p>One of my biggest takeaways from the internship was personal growth and self-development. In college, we’re not really used to having a fixed routine but when you’re working at a company like Hindustan Unilever, that changes. You’re expected to stick to a schedule, be accountable, and report your progress regularly to stakeholders. This shift taught me to take ownership of my work, manage my time better, and deliver on deadlines, all while juggling multiple priorities.

Over the course of those eight weeks, I developed a genuine drive to understand my project in depth. I found myself diving into research, applying concepts I had learned in my chemical engineering courses, and developing quick problem-solving skills to keep up with the pace. One of my key learnings was the importance of exploring multiple approaches to a problem- the company actively encourages you to think out of the box and propose innovative, practical solutions.

Another major learning was the value of open communication. There were many times I didn’t fully understand something and I realized that simply talking to people around me often led to the fastest and most helpful answers. You’re never expected to know everything. Even asking the most basic questions can lead to meaningful insights. Being transparent and communicative with your tutor, stakeholders, and peers was something I learned to prioritize and value.

On the technical front, I went from barely knowing how the supply chain works to gaining a comprehensive understanding of how FMCG factories operate - from procurement and production to delivery. I also learned how a massive organization like HUL functions at the head office level, how decisions are made, how cross-functional teams work together, and how structured the internal processes are.
