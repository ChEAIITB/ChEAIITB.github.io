                        <p><b>How did you choose your current role and company? Did you apply for the same domain during placements as your third-year internship? If not, why?</b><br>
                            I initially planned to prepare for tech roles for my placement, but I also had experience and strengths in consulting, so I considered applying for consulting and product roles as well. Since my technical skills weren’t as strong, I decided to prioritize consulting and keep tech as a backup option. I interned at Accenture, where I worked on consulting and data-related projects. Although I wanted to apply for tech roles, I wasn’t selected during placements. Instead, I applied to KPMG for a consulting position and was successfully selected.
                            
 </p>
                        <p><b>How crucial were the pre-placement talks and would you recommend attending them?</b><br>
                            The pre-placement talk (PPTs) were mostly focused on company branding and weren’t highly relevant. However, since the placement season can be unpredictable, these talks can still be helpful as they provide some direction.

                        <p><b>	How was the shortlisting process ?</b>
                            The selection process typically involves an initial test and resume screening. Companies had specific CPI criteria and would shortlist students based on their CPI, relevant keywords in their resumes, or involvement in particular clubs.</p>
                            <p>
                                <b>Are there any set of repetitive que or cases that you noticed especially in HR or GD? </b><br>
The cases given during interviews were quite specific and not repetitive. However, in the HR round, the focus was primarily on introductions and resume screening.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>How did you prepare for each round? </b><br>
For tech preparation, I focused on DSA, some theory, and Machine Learning. For the HR round, I used a book with 64 common HR questions but only went through the first 15-20 pages. You don’t need to dive deep—going through 10-20 questions gives a good idea and helps you navigate the interview. For consulting prep, I practiced cases from books, and for product roles, I found the new books in the market less relevant. Watching a few YouTube videos was more helpful for that.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>If you have had to do your prep all over again, what changes would you do?</b><br>
I don’t think I would have changed much in my preparation—what I did was enough. I just wish I had been more confident and reassured myself that I would get placed, even if it took some time. I should have stayed more positive, knowing that something would eventually work out and I would secure a placement.

                            </p>
                            <p><b>	Key learnings from the process and a final note for fourthies.</b><br>
                                A key learning I’d share with all final-year students is to be more patient. The shortlisting process can feel very random—sometimes people who may not seem deserving get placed. But in the end, you need to have confidence and patience, trusting that you will get placed. Just keep trying every day, and things will eventually work out.
