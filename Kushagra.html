                        <p>Pre-internship phase

Enthu: In chemical engineering, I am more inclined towards modelling and simulation part. Hope it continues. :P

Fundae:

Make a good resume, don’t exaggerate it.

Be good at your speaking skills, do hand movements if necessary.

Be confident at what you are delivering.

Don’t expect too much.

Selection process:

My interview was telephonic. In general these kind of interviews are chill because you don’t have to talk to them face to face. So I was interviewed mostly on the projects that I had done. In a telephonic interview also be confident about what you are telling and be loud and clear.

Internship

SABIC stands for Saudi Arabia Basic Industries Corporation.  Mostly deals with the plastic products that have day to day uses. For more info just google it. :D

First day was great. As you enter the office the infrastructure will make you flat. You will be given a separate desk with your name written on it (that feels though :P) Then you will be assigned to your mentor and team members. Work culture is great. Don’t hesitate in asking doubts as it is a part of your learning process and by this you will also get to know the people working there. My so called group there had ten members so we all went for lunch and tiffin together. In this way, you also get to know more about the corporate culture you are working in.

My project was modelling related to FCC Process and then implementing in ASPEN. It involved literature part, then developing the equations and thus finally incorporating it into Aspen.</p>

Accommodation, travel and food, city

For accommodation, you have to search for it on your own. Believe me, no place is better than Koramangala. It’s basically, because it is a home to many exotic food outlets and pubs. It feels like every day you wanna try a new one :D. Bengaluru is a great city. Weather is fantastic as always. Sometimes rain may cause you some trouble but hey who does not like rain. It is highly recommended to travel nearby hill stations every weekend :D. I guess exploring the city by yourself will give you more fun rather than just listening from others. Lunch and travel cost were being taken care of by the company. The company is situated a  little bit outside the city but they provide the bus transport for that so I guess transportation will not be much of an issue.

TAKEAWAY:

As it was my first internship I got a pretty much idea about how the corporate culture works, how accountability plays a role and yes got a little bit sense of how to dress nicely :P and ya miss all the fun that I had during my weekend trips.
