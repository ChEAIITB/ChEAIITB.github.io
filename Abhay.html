                        <p>Pre internship phase
At first, as most of the guys I was not sure about what should I choose but after few rounds of discussion with my seniors, I wanted to go for either university intern or some core intern and as it turns out, I am here, working in one of the biggest steel manufacturing companies in the world. The selection procedure was same as for most of the firms. We had an online exam prior to the interview, which was quite easy with little bit revision of some core courses. The interview was half an hour long with both HR and technical questions.</p>

                        <p>About Internship
With all the excitement and fun, the first day was really great here with a lot of freebies. But the real adventure starts on entering the plant, the plant is so large and has so many different sections that you can’t explore the entire plant even in two months, but try as much as you can, it’s amazing. Experiencing the work in a steel plant is great as you can actually see all the theoretical principles and operation that you have ever studied in action.

The work culture here is really open here, you can approach your head or chief of your department whenever you want, with any problem, and they are always helpful. Since everyone has a very busy schedule here, lined up with meetings and daily goals, you also have to move fast as surely you don’t want to be left behind.

My project is related to the final product manufacturing section, and the kind of freedom which I get with my project is amazing. I got the full authorities of making any type changes based on my analysis and doing experiments with production line which may affect the product quality or production rate, but that’s the kind of trust they put on us. New idea and innovation are always encouraged here.

 

About the Place
Well, this is one part which not as exciting as the rest of internship. Jamshedpur is a small city, you can find all the necessary things but it’s definitely not as luxurious as Bombay. There are few tourist places for you to visit. No malls, just few shopping complex and a couple of movie halls but for food lovers, it has few good restaurants.

Takeaway
If you even have a slight interest in core, you should definitely give it a shot. The internship will help you experience all the exciting aspects of core engineering and show you how thrilling it is to use your theoretical knowledge to tackle the daily problems that you face in a plant.</p>
