                        <p>Hello, I'm Yashwant Singh, currently pursuing my fourth year in chemical engineering. Hailing from Sikar, Rajasthan, I had the wonderful opportunity to intern at Dr. Reddy's Laboratories during my third year, where I served as a Technical Intern. </p>
                        <p> The duration of the internship was 2 months. Among the several locations of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, I was assigned to work at the Bachupally, Hyderabad site. The work culture varied based on teams and sites, but on average, I found the workload to be reasonable, and the work environment was not overly pressurized. </p>

                        <p>Dr. Reddy's Laboratories is a prominent global manufacturer of generic pharmaceuticals, organized into three sections: IPDO, CTO, and FTO. Their primary focus involves either manufacturing, researching, and developing APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients) or procuring them for large-scale drug production. The company generates a significant portion of its revenue from the US market. During my internship, I had the privilege to work in the Modelling and Simulations lab, where my main task was to enhance the efficiency of a widely used industrial equipment called the Cyclone Separator. </p>

                <div class="blog-c2">
                        <p>Having explored various options, I knew that my interest lay in Product Management, and I was certain that IT and coding weren't my preferred paths. I decided to concentrate on core-based companies to gain a clearer understanding of whether I wanted to pursue a career in that direction. Although I didn't take minors or specializations, I remained open to exploring finance and core areas. <br><br>The selection process followed a standard procedure, starting with resume shortlisting, followed by a test for qualified candidates. Those who cleared the test proceeded to a Group Discussion, and then the final interviews. To prepare for the interview, I created an HR document with standard questions and focused on enhancing my resume, especially the projects and PoR section. Additionally, I conducted mock interviews with friends and sought their feedback. <br><br>The induction at DRL spanned three days and, to be honest, some parts were quite tedious, with professionals from different departments discussing their work, which often delved into technical jargon. However, there were enjoyable activities that allowed us to mingle with fellow interns from various IITs, fostering new connections through games and interactions.<br><br>My role in the Modelling and Simulations lab involved working with ANSYS software, including SpaceClaim, Fluent, and Rocky. Since we had just one license for ANSYS shared among three interns, we took turns using it. The simulations themselves were time-consuming, often lasting 2-3 days, which left us with some downtime. Nonetheless, I found the work highly rewarding, as I acquired proficiency in these software tools, thanks to a supportive and patient Project Owner who prioritized learning over strict outcomes, resulting in a stress-free environment. </p>

                      <img src="a4''.jpg">
                      <p>The most cherished aspect of my time at DRL was the incredible people I met. Forming strong bonds with my colleagues, I made lifelong friends, making the entire journey, with its ups and downs, more enjoyable. Weekends were a blast, and I particularly relished our outings to clubs. <br><br>For accommodation during the internship, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories offered us a choice between staying at their hotel or receiving monetary compensation to arrange for our own lodging. I opted for the company accommodation, which proved hassle-free. The hotel was conveniently located around 7-8 km from the office, and we commuted daily using ride-sharing services like Ola or Uber, splitting the costs among the fellow interns who stayed at the same place. <br><br>The internship proved highly impactful to me, as I gained hands-on experience with new software and applied theoretical knowledge practically, fostering significant learning. I also ended up making really great friends for a lifetime and making endless memories. Additionally, the internship offered an excellent chance for networking, allowing meaningful interactions with professionals and providing valuable insights into the workings of corporate companies.  </p>
