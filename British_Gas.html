How did you prepare your resume? Any help/material you took/read?
The resume looked totally dedicated to Oil and gas Profile.
Did you attend Pre-Placement talks? Did you gain anything out of them? Did you talk to anyone else about choosing between jobs/companies?
PPT is alwz important.... you get to know what they want..... ask in PPT and return back in interview............
Any website/material you read/used for preparation of Case-Studies/HR Questions/Puzzles/Technical/GDs? (Your sending across links/documents would help us compile a single point resource
Lot of them are available on Net and LAN.... but its better to prepare ur self..... this helps you to help ur self and introspect ur self...... do it judiciously
For interview/GD/Test preparation did you prepare in groups or individually? Which one do you think helps the most? Any details you provide will be of great help.
Prepare in groups..... and independently..... both are equally imp.......
What was the procedure of selection? Roughly how many people were short listed at each level? And how many were made final offers?
10 shortlisted..... group activites..... GD/ PI/ etc many other exercises.....
Walk us through the GDs/Interviews of this company. The questions that you were asked and other details that you may remember would be of great help.
"Cant disclose...." Talk in person normal HR questions.....</p>
