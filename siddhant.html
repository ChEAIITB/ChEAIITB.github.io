                        <p>Hello everyone! I'm Siddhant Osatwal, an undergraduate in Chemical Engineering currently in my fourth and final year at IIT Bombay. In the previous year, I was the Events & PR Head at E-Cell, IIT Bombay, and today, I want to share my exhilarating journey as an Associate Consultant Intern (ACI) at Bain & Company. As an ACI, I had the privilege of working at one of the top management consulting firms in the world, where I gained invaluable experiences, learned essential strategies, and developed a broader mindset to approach complex business problems.</p>

                        <p>The Internship Offer and Induction Period:<br><br> I was thrilled to receive an internship offer from Bain & Company, a top management consulting firm that advises leaders on strategy, marketing, organization, operations, IT, and M&A across all industries. The internship was scheduled for 8 weeks, during June and July, and I got the opportunity to work from the Mumbai office. As I embarked on this new chapter, I was filled with excitement and eagerness to explore the world of management consulting. One of the main reasons I was drawn to consulting was my fascination with different strategies that companies employ to tackle complex business challenges.</p>

                        <p>The induction period at Bain & Company was nothing short of amazing. It provided an in-depth understanding of the company's values, approaches to problem-solving, toolkits, and the opportunity to learn from experienced professionals. Moreover, getting to know my fellow interns and colleagues created a sense of camaraderie and support, which made me feel right at home. The company provided accommodation at a nearby hotel, which made commuting to and from the office hassle-free.<br><br>The Work Culture at Bain & Company: <br><br>Bain & Company's work culture was everything I had hoped for â€“ supportive, sustainable, and enjoyable. Contrary to the typical perception of long working hours in consulting, I was pleasantly surprised by the work-life balance that Bain offered. It allowed us to work efficiently while also providing ample opportunities for personal growth and learning.</p>

His guidance and concern for my well-being made the internship experience truly remarkable.<br><br>Memorable Fridays:<br><br> At Bain & Company, Fridays were not just any regular workday. It was a time for employees to unwind and connect through various fun activities. From VR gaming and Friday beers to caricatures and in-office spa sessions, the company ensured that we had a well-deserved break at the end of each week. To culminate the experience, the final Friday evening of the internship was marked by an evening show of Oppenheimer, making it an unforgettable memory.<br><br>Internship Preparation: <br><br>To prepare myself for the challenges ahead, I diligently referred to resources like Case Interviews Cracked (CIC) videos, the Victor Cheng series, and the CIC Casebook. Practicing with my friends and seniors was instrumental in developing the right mindset and honing my problem-solving skills.<br><br>Conclusion:<br><br> As I reflect on my summer internship journey at Bain & Company, I can't help but feel grateful for the remarkable experience it has been. The learning, the growth, the support, and the enjoyable Fridays have left a lasting impression on me. My time at Bain has solidified my passion for consulting, and I am excited about the future opportunities this experience has opened up for me.<br><br>To all aspiring interns out there, I would highly recommend exploring the world of management consulting with an open mind and a willingness to learn. Who knows, it might just turn out to be the most transformative experience of your life, as it did for me!</p>
