                        <p> 
<br><br>
Here are some insights that really helped me when I went through the HPCL placement process. HPCL is not just about testing your technical skills; they’re really focused on understanding your mindset, attitude, and overall seriousness. Here’s what I learned from my experience that might help you <br><br>
<br><br><b> Give HR Questions the Attention They Deserve
</b>
<br><br>
- Trust me, HPCL cares a lot about the HR part of the interview. They want to see where your head's at—your goals, your attitude, and how well you’ll fit into the company. They’re paying close attention to how thoughtfully you respond to these questions. I’ve seen people lose points by not taking these seriously. Make sure you’re fully prepared to answer with sincerity and focus.
  <br><br>
<br><br><b> Know Your Core Subject Inside Out</b>
<br><br>
- You’ll likely be asked to choose a favorite subject in chemical engineering, so be ready to back it up with knowledge. In my case, I picked one core subject that I knew well, and I made sure I could handle in-depth questions about it. It’s not just about your technical understanding—they want to see genuine interest and confidence in your field. <br><br>
<br><br><b> Handle the Pressure of the Interview Panel
</b>
<br><br>
- HPCL’s interview panels can include some of the top leaders in the industry—Executive Directors, Chief General Managers, even board members sometimes. They might throw in unexpected questions or interrupt you to test how you handle stress. Keep your cool, stay composed, and show that you can think on your feet. It’s part of their way of seeing if you’re ready for the challenges of the job.  

<br><br><br><br>
<b>Group Discussion (GD) is Key</b>
<br><br>
- You’ll probably face a GD with about 8–10 other candidates. It’s not just a formality—they’re watching how well you can communicate under pressure and how respectfully you handle other people’s viewpoints. Make sure to contribute meaningfully, stay respectful, and show you’re a team player. That’s something HPCL values a lot.
<br><br> <br><br><b>Final Thoughts
</b>
<br><br>
HPCL’s interview process is thorough and challenging. They’re looking for technical skill, but just as much, they’re looking for the right attitude and the ability to keep your cool under pressure. If you go in prepared, confident, and focused, you’ll have a great shot. Best of luck!
<!-- <br><br> <br><br><b>Any tips for placement preparation?</b>
<br><br>
Start early and prepare steadily to avoid last-minute stress. Plan your preparation, especially for technical subjects, and trust in your efforts. Stress is natural, but with the right preparation, things will fall into place<b>How did you prepare for the placement process?</b>
<br><br> <br><br>
<b> If you had to redo your preparation, what would you do differently?</b>
<br><br>
Honestly, I wouldn’t change a thing. I prepared well and have no regrets about the process.    
<br><br> <br><br><b>What are your key learnings from the placement process, and do you have any advice for final-year students?</b>
<br><br>
Placement season is often the first time students face such intense pressure, and it can be very hectic. However, it pushes you to grow and teaches you resilience and time management. You’ll achieve in three months what you couldn’t in four years. Even if you don’t land your dream job, the experience will make you stronger and better prepared for future challenges. My advice to final-year students is to start early, plan effectively, and embrace the process. Trust that everything will work out in the end.  
<br><br> <br><br><b>Were there any repetitive questions in the HR or technical rounds?</b>
<br><br>
Yes, some questions are quite standard. In the HR round, they often ask about your strengths and weaknesses, your biggest achievements, and times when you took on a challenge. In the technical round, they focus on topics like pumps, distillation columns, heat transfer, and basic fluid mechanics concepts.

                        <p><b>	How was the shortlisting process ?</b>
                            The selection process typically involves an initial test and resume screening. Companies had specific CPI criteria and would shortlist students based on their CPI, relevant keywords in their resumes, or involvement in particular clubs.</p>
                            <p>
                                <b>Are there any set of repetitive que or cases that you noticed especially in HR or GD? </b><br>
The cases given during interviews were quite specific and not repetitive. However, in the HR round, the focus was primarily on introductions and resume screening.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>How did you prepare for each round? </b><br>
For tech preparation, I focused on DSA, some theory, and Machine Learning. For the HR round, I used a book with 64 common HR questions but only went through the first 15-20 pages. You don’t need to dive deep—going through 10-20 questions gives a good idea and helps you navigate the interview. For consulting prep, I practiced cases from books, and for product roles, I found the new books in the market less relevant. Watching a few YouTube videos was more helpful for that.

                                <b>If you have had to do your prep all over again, what changes would you do?</b><br>
I don’t think I would have changed much in my preparation—what I did was enough. I just wish I had been more confident and reassured myself that I would get placed, even if it took some time. I should have stayed more positive, knowing that something would eventually work out and I would secure a placement.

                            <p><b>	Key learnings from the process and a final note for fourthies.</b><br>
                                A key learning I’d share with all final-year students is to be more patient. The shortlisting process can feel very random—sometimes people who may not seem deserving get placed. But in the end, you need to have confidence and patience, trusting that you will get placed. Just keep trying every day, and things will eventually work out.
