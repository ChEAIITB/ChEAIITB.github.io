    <b>
        What was your role, and what kind of work did you do during the internship? 
    </b><br>
    My role was Intern as a chemical engineer. My job nature was to study the plant I was posted at from all aspects. I had great opportunity to learn plant operations and contributing solving ongoing problems or optimizing the plant system. I had the opportunity to be part of the designing team and to understand various designing aspects by Hands -On designing various plant equipments for expansion project. I had unique experience witnessing the shutdown of a chemical plant and was also able to see different equipments internally.
 </p>
 <p> <b>What were the key skills (technical or soft skills) that you gained from this experience?</b><br>
    Skills I gained from this experience mainly included â€“ practical knowledge of chemical engineering basics, to understand plant basic documents, learn about different unit operations and unit processes, design approach of the plant equipments, communication skills, teamwork, problem-solving skills, etc.</p>
 <p>
    <b>
        Did you receive mentorship during your internship? How did it help shape your experience? 
    </b><br>
    Yes, my assigned mentor in plant was incredibly helpful and supportive. His guidance played a crucial role in my learning process, ensuring I could navigate challenges effectively. He was facilitating me to troubleshoot plant-teething issues. His mentorship enriched my experience and deepened my understanding of core concepts of operation and process design.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
<b>
    What advice would you give to 2nd-year students applying for summer internships?
</b><br>
I would suggest to do a internship in 2nd year so that students get a hands on experience over what they have studied till now. At the early stage, it will teach us teamwork, understanding, communication and many other skills. Internships push us out of our comfort zones and that is very important to develop as a person. You get to meet new people, interact with them, know how to act independently in certain situations, take your own decisions etc. It will also help you to understand your area of interest.
