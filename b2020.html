Ab insti aagaye ab life chill hai :) Then come Midsem, Endsem, Minor, electives, PoR, intern. How many times have we heard “Bas ye karlo sab chill hai aage”. How long have we been waiting for the ‘chill’?  Or did the ‘chill’ really begin a long time ago and we never realized that cause we were so focused on the goal?...<p>
