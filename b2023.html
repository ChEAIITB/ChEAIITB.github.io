I got this internship via MITACS (keep checking the website and ping me for doubts). I reached the city a week before the actual date of my intern, and this was because it was the best option for travel. I got good 5 days to explore the lovely city and I went to visit the professor on 28th thinking that I can get an informal intro with him but that later turned to be my first day of work. </p>

It’s been such a rollercoaster experience from the day I started preparing for the intern season to today when I'm done with my internship and looking forward to my fourth year and future career options. When I look back at this experience and all the things that I faced, I can just say “Guys! Anything can happen anytime to anyone. There are bad days where you’ll feel nothing is going your way but at the same time, you’ll have your share of good ones.</p>
