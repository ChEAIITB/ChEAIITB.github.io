                        <p>Hi reader! I’m Dishita, a fourthie from the Department of Chemical Engineering. I completed my
8 week long internship at Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) as a part of their coveted Unilever
Leadership Internship Program (ULIP) recently.</p>
<p>You are up for one of the most demanding but rewarding phases of your insti lives, the intern
season. I’m here to share my part of the experience, hope it helps! </p>

                        <p>THE INTERN SEASON: <br><br>
According to my understanding of the profiles that come for hire, I decided to prepare for FMCG
(supply chain) and Consult. FMCG as a sector has the potential to give you a variety of
opportunities. You can dabble in demand planning, factory operations, supply/ delivery logistics,
quality assurance, sustainability management and roles in finance, marketing, consulting. As
someone in the nascent stage of my career, I found the diversity in options a green flag. </p>
                    </div>
                <div class="blog-c2">
                        <p>FMCG values both projects (especially course projects) and PoRs. I ensured that I highlighted
both in my resume. Your projects show your understanding of your B.Tech and your analytical
skills, while your PoRs highlight your overall fit to roles. You should include extra-curricular
activities and get your resumes reviewed from seniors.<br><br>
As a part of my preparation, in addition to talking to seniors, I began scouring the HUL website.
This helped me understand the firm’s working and purpose. I gained clarity on its ideals &
portfolio. The first round of the process is the Application Form. Give it sufficient time as it is
crucial to form structured responses tailored to your understanding of the company. The shortlist
for the consequent round is released on the basis of this form and your resume. Note that while
CPI is not a key factor here, it is significant.<br><br>
My website findings, along with other supply chain articles helped me build my knowledge of the
profile. For the Case Assessment or the HireViu round, what surprisingly helped was my case
study prep for Consult. It helped me build my answers logically. That, along with my knowledge
of the profile, helped me answer the 3 Supply Chain problem statements that were to be
answered within a stipulated time.<br><br>
Once the interview shortlist was announced, I called up previously selected seniors to know
what was expected in the interview and started my prep accordingly. Preparing your resume
extensively is key, my interview was heavily based on it. I went through all my projects
obsessively. I derived all relevant equations from scratch and re-read all reference sites/ papers.
They asked me questions focused on my heat transfer project (my senior had had the same
experience, so I was prepared, yay!) and were interested in my extra currics. What I
*personally* believe to be an interaction that made them select me was the question that I
asked them at the end of the interview. Make sure to keep a question ready for your
interviewers. It should display your interest and knowledge about the firm. </p>

                      <p>ABOUT THE INTERN : <br><br>
At HUL, I worked as a Supply Chain (SC) intern on a project focusing on Last Mile delivery
planning logistics (route planning and a module on payment collection & reconciliation). My
base location was the Mumbai Head Office and I had to travel to Chennai and Bhubaneshwar
for my project. They provided us with accommodation in a Guesthouse at Wadala. I preferred to
travel from home as I was based out of Mumbai. Some interns were stationed at various
factories across the country as well.<br><br>
I was super excited to dive into my project once the project charter was shared. Every intern
was assigned a coach, a tutor and a buddy (I wasn’t assigned a coach, which worked out fine).
We were expected to communicate with colleagues who were involved in our projects to varying
degrees. The culture there was development oriented and encouraged open-communication.
The first week eased us into the project beginning with a day-long induction (which ended with
an amazing dinner with all the coaches and tutors for the ULIPs). They expected us to gain
clarity on our project statements within week 1.<br><br>
Entering the corporate world felt exciting and my project never fell short to my expectations. The
stint was especially challenging due to the diverse portfolio of HUL in India which demanded
complexity in the solution. I got to interact with various internal and external stakeholders,
including a couple of startups involved in the project. I visited multiple distribution centers, went
on market visits and got the opportunity to visit a fully automated depot. The problem statement
kept transforming as my stint progressed which made the whole experience intense and
interesting. After the initial assessment of the data given to me for a part of the project, I realized
it did not align with the scope of my project which made it difficult to work on. Going through it
from different perspectives helped me identify certain valuable insights that could be used and I
had to redefine the scope of my project accordingly.<br><br>
My work went beyond the usual 9am to 5pm timings multiple times, so a little caution for the
people expecting a work-life balance during their internship. Looking at the positives, I gained
abundant knowledge and exposure during my intern. I learnt to define the direction to solve
problems and ways to adequately present solutions to a multitude of people.<br><br>
END NOTE : <br><br>
This 8 week experience felt rewarding to me. I’m sure all interns would have had their ups and
downs, so did I. I could make it through due to my amazing tutor and team members (and
lunches with my co-interns). The Hazelnut Cappuccino at the Bru Cafe at the Head Office
deserves a special mention. This fruitful experience has equipped me with skills that will
definitely help me in my future endeavors. So, reader, all the very best to you! </p>
