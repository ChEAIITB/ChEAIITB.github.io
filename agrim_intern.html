</b>
I was referred for this intern position by an employee of RIL.</p>
-->

                    <p>Hey everyone, this is Agrim Jain, a pre-final year undergrad in the department.
</p>
                        <p>
<b> What was your motivation for the internship and what was the recruitment process like? Why did you chose to do an internship instead of other options, such as projects or bootcamp? How did you prep for this role?

</b><br>
My motivation was just to explore my interest in the world of finance (pun not intended). Having done many projects and competitions, I wanted to get a taste of the real world. The recruitment process included a short offline interview. I did not prepare for it explicitly, just the things that I learned from college projects and activities were enough. My enthusiasm was precisely what they were looking for.


 </p>
 <p>
    <b>Did you get this internship via apping? If yes, highlight the apping process.
</b><br>
    No

   <!-- <br>  During my internship, I worked on designing heat exchangers and batch distillation columns, selecting a suitable coolant for an exothermic reaction, and researching on ways to minimize solvent wastage through Literature Review. I also visited many plants and learned about various equipment. -->
    </p>
 <p>
    <b>
       Can you explain your role in the internship? What jobs were you expected to perform and what projects were you involved with?

  </b><br>
  I worked in the Capital Markets domain which is a great place to learn the basics. I was assigned a macroeconomic study project. I was expected to match how the global and national events translated into changes in the bank's liabilities.

   <p>
    <b>
        What were the most exciting aspects of the internship? What were the most challenging aspects?
</b><br>
    The most exciting part was to learn from the people around me. One person who used to sit two desks beside me was actually working with Vishal Mega Mart during their IPO: the company got listed while I was an intern! Over chai, that person told me all about it, how he contributed, how he was invited by the promoters of the company to the BSE for the listing, etc. 
The most challenging aspect was obviously travel! It is tragic how tiring I found the commute to Mahalaxmi from the institute via local train (had to change trains at 6:30PM in Dadar: the rush at this time is insane).Other than that, no complaints!
<p>
    <b>
        What was the culture like in your office? How did the company treat the interns and what were you provided with?

    </b><br>
   
The office was huge, so I got a slight taste of the corporate world. The people there were incredibly welcoming. From the people who I sat amongst to the VP who had his own chamber: they were all super helpful. I loved the humility of the entire workforce. 
<p>
    <b>
         What were your key learnings from the internship and any tips you would like to give to your juniors?
<br> </b>
   One thing that I took away with me was the power of compounding. In this day and age, I have found myself looking for short term results. I learnt that this approach can only harm you in the long run. I want to become the person who contributes in any situation and pursue the long term rewards instead of getting thrown around by the temptations of temporary fulfillments. Long term motivation requires vision but guarantees growth!
