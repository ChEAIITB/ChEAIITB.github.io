</b>
I was referred for this intern position by an employee of RIL.</p>

                        <p>
<b> How did you find and secure your 2nd-year summer internship?
</b><br>
I had decided early on that I wanted to do an internship in the core chemical domain to apply my theoretical knowledge in an industrial setting and gain hands-on exposure. I started searching for relevant companies on LinkedIn and reaching out to contacts. Later, I found out that one of my father’s friends worked as a senior researcher at Zydus Pharmaceuticals. I spoke with him about my interest, and he recommended me for an internship at Zydus’ Mumbai (Ambarnath) unit. This recommendation helped me secure the internship.

 </p>
 <p>
    <b>What was the selection process like?</b><br>
    The HR team contacted me and asked for my resume. After reviewing it, they scheduled an offline meeting, which was more of a discussion rather than a formal interview. The HR representative gave me an overview of the company and discussed my potential work, which was primarily in process engineering.
   <br>  During my internship, I worked on designing heat exchangers and batch distillation columns, selecting a suitable coolant for an exothermic reaction, and researching on ways to minimize solvent wastage through Literature Review. I also visited many plants and learned about various equipment.
    </p>
 <p>
    <b>
        What key skills did you gain from this experience?
  </b><br>
  I learned how to apply theoretical knowledge to real industrial problems. Additionally, I interacted with professionals from various departments of the company such as engineering, procurement, and finance, gaining insights into their roles and the overall functioning of the industry. Managing my internship alongside a research project also helped me develop strong time management skills, as I had to balance both commitments while commuting to and from the company regularly. </p>
 <p> <b>Did you receive mentorship during your internship? How did it shape your experience?
</b><br>
    Skills I gained from this experience mainly included – practical knowledge of chemical engineering basics, to understand plant basic documents, learn about different unit operations and unit processes, design approach of the plant equipments, communication skills, teamwork, problem-solving skills, etc.</p>
 <p>
    <b>
        Did you receive mentorship during your internship? How did it help shape your experience? 
    </b><br>
    Yes, my manager provided valuable guidance. He explained the general working of the pharmaceutical industry, the key processes involved in API manufacturing, and what it’s like to work in the core industry. We also had discussions about career choices, including whether I should pursue higher studies. These conversations played a crucial role in shaping my perspective on different career paths.</p>
 <p>
    <b>
        How has this internship influenced your career choices or future plans?
    </b><br>
    While I gained a lot of knowledge and firsthand experience in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, having been involved in various research projects, I realized that I enjoy research work more than the typical industrial roles. This internship made me consider research as a possible career option and encouraged me to explore it further. </p>
 <p>
    <b>
         How much did this internship help in preparing and securing for your 3rd-year internship applications?  
   <br> </b>
   Having prior industry experience was beneficial for my 3rd-year internship applications. I included my experience in my resume and mentioned it in my Statements of Purpose (SOPs) for some applications. Overall, it did add credibility to my profile. </p>
 <p>
<b>
    What advice would you give to 2nd-year students applying for summer internships?
</b><br>
The main focus of an internship should be learning, gaining exposure, and self-improvement. Don’t do an internship just for the sake of filling your resume—it won’t be beneficial if you’re not genuinely interested. Instead, treat it as a learning opportunity to explore your interests.
<br> If you’re unable to secure an internship, don’t worry. Doing a research project dedicatedly in an area of your interest can be much more valuable than doing an internship half-heartedly. Also, work on your soft skills, such as public speaking and presentation skills, as they play a crucial role in GDs and HR rounds during the selection process.
