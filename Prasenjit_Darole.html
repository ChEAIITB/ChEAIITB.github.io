                        <!-- <img src=""> -->
                        <p> <b>Why did you choose BPCL and this specific role?</b>
<br><br><br>
My interest in chemical core roles began during my 2nd-year internship at BASF, Gujarat. That experience gave me valuable insights into the industry and helped me decide to pursue a career in the chemical core domain. I chose BPCL because it’s a core chemical company and a refinery, which is much more complex than a regular chemical plant. The challenging nature of the work appealed to me. Moreover, BPCL offers broader verticals, including sales, along with operational and production roles, making it an excellent choice for career growth. <br><br>
<b>Was the domain you applied for the same as your 3rd-year internship?</b>
<br><br><br><br>
Yes, I interned at HPCL during my 3rd year, which is also a core chemical company. All my internships have been in the chemical core domain, which helped me build a strong foundation and reaffirm my interest in this field.  <br><br>
<b>How important were the pre-placement talks (PPTs), and would you recommend attending them?</b>
<br><br><br><br>
Attending PPTs is extremely important. They provide insights into the company’s expectations, work culture, and values. During interviews, companies assess not just your technical skills but also whether your values align with theirs. Even if you’re technically sound, a lack of understanding about the company can hurt your chances. PPTs also help you anticipate potential interview questions. I would strongly recommend attending them to gain a competitive edge. <br><br>
<b> Can you describe the selection process at BPCL?</b>
<br><br><br><br>
The process starts with a CPI cutoff, which was 7.5 for the General category during my year. Shortlisted candidates then go through two interview rounds.  
-Technical Round: A panel of 10–12 members asks questions related to core chemical topics like pumps, distillation columns, heat transfer, and fluid mechanics.  
- HR Round: Conducted by a three-member panel, including a clinical psychologist. The focus is on behavioral and situational questions, such as your strengths and weaknesses, significant achievements, and challenges you’ve faced. 
<br>
<b>Were there any repetitive questions in the HR or technical rounds?</b>
<br><br><br><br>
Yes, some questions are quite standard. In the HR round, they often ask about your strengths and weaknesses, your biggest achievements, and times when you took on a challenge. In the technical round, they focus on topics like pumps, distillation columns, heat transfer, and basic fluid mechanics concepts. 
<br> <b>How did you prepare for the placement process?</b>
<br><br><br><br>
I primarily referred to the course material we were taught during college. For HR preparation, I used the book *64 Standard Questions for an HR Interview* and consulted repositories prepared by seniors. I didn’t use any external resources, as the academic content was sufficient for the technical rounds.
<b>Any tips for placement preparation?</b>
<br><br><br><br>
Start early and prepare steadily to avoid last-minute stress. Plan your preparation, especially for technical subjects, and trust in your efforts. Stress is natural, but with the right preparation, things will fall into place<b>How did you prepare for the placement process?</b>
<br><br><br><br>
<b> If you had to redo your preparation, what would you do differently?</b>
<br><br><br><br>
Honestly, I wouldn’t change a thing. I prepared well and have no regrets about the process.    
<br><b>What are your key learnings from the placement process, and do you have any advice for final-year students?</b>
<br><br><br><br>
Placement season is often the first time students face such intense pressure, and it can be very hectic. However, it pushes you to grow and teaches you resilience and time management. You’ll achieve in three months what you couldn’t in four years. Even if you don’t land your dream job, the experience will make you stronger and better prepared for future challenges. My advice to final-year students is to start early, plan effectively, and embrace the process. Trust that everything will work out in the end.

                        <p><b>	How was the shortlisting process ?</b>
                            The selection process typically involves an initial test and resume screening. Companies had specific CPI criteria and would shortlist students based on their CPI, relevant keywords in their resumes, or involvement in particular clubs.</p>
                            <p>
                                <b>Are there any set of repetitive que or cases that you noticed especially in HR or GD? </b><br>
The cases given during interviews were quite specific and not repetitive. However, in the HR round, the focus was primarily on introductions and resume screening.

                            <p>
                                <b>How did you prepare for each round? </b><br>
For tech preparation, I focused on DSA, some theory, and Machine Learning. For the HR round, I used a book with 64 common HR questions but only went through the first 15-20 pages. You don’t need to dive deep—going through 10-20 questions gives a good idea and helps you navigate the interview. For consulting prep, I practiced cases from books, and for product roles, I found the new books in the market less relevant. Watching a few YouTube videos was more helpful for that.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>If you have had to do your prep all over again, what changes would you do?</b><br>
I don’t think I would have changed much in my preparation—what I did was enough. I just wish I had been more confident and reassured myself that I would get placed, even if it took some time. I should have stayed more positive, knowing that something would eventually work out and I would secure a placement.

                            </p>
                            <p><b>	Key learnings from the process and a final note for fourthies.</b><br>
                                A key learning I’d share with all final-year students is to be more patient. The shortlisting process can feel very random—sometimes people who may not seem deserving get placed. But in the end, you need to have confidence and patience, trusting that you will get placed. Just keep trying every day, and things will eventually work out.
