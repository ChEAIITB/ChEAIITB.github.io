                        <p>I am <b>Atharva Yeole</b>, a third-year undergraduate in the Chemical Engineering Department. I’m from Pune and a finance enthusiast. I have previously served as Design Secy at ChEA<br><br>
                        <b>About the Internship</b><br><br>
The internship was from 8th May 2023 to 14th July 2023. The office was located in Marol, Andheri East, Mumbai and it was a small office with a staff of about 20 and focused on detailed work in small teams<br><b>Renaissance Investment Managers</b> is a public equity firm focused on long-term investments. They work on identifying potential investment opportunities in the Public equities in various sectors like Consumer Goods, Automobile, IT, Banking and Financial Services, Pharmaceuticals, and Chemicals.<br>I was assigned to prepare a detailed report on the Indian Pharmaceutical Market containing the market size, major players, top drugs and brands, and understanding business models & financials of top pharmaceutical firms in India
<br><br>
<b>Work Experience</b><br><br>
I worked in the research division of the firm which included 5 people (1 Fund Manager and 4 full-time analysts) and I was the summer intern. Each analyst was allotted one sector to look out for and we were overlooked by the Fund Manager. 
I was guided and mentored by Mr. Pawan Parakh, the Fund Manager, who used to hold a weekly one-on-one meeting to see the progress of my report and always used to give me his perspective for that domain and how we should think in terms of investments<br>My timings for the job were from 9:30 AM - 6 PM, so was not left with a lot of time on weekdays
Mostly I used to sleep during weekends but explored a lot of new food places in the city.
My office was around 6 km from the Institute, so I used to commute by auto every day with one senior from the institute who was also interning in the same corporate complex<br>Also, it was very beneficial to have a real on-site professional experience, because your interviews can just go round and round about that point only and it becomes more of a conversion + 4 good lines on your resume :)<br><br>

<b>My Sophomore Year</b><br><br>I’m not pursuing any minor, but I always wanted to explore finance and was not sure what to start with as it has so many domains Trading, Quant, IB, Public and Private Equity, and Venture Capital. I was not sure what to start, so I tried in almost all fields and got an opportunity in the Public Equity space.<br>I was <b>Design Secy</b> at <b>ChEA</b> and <b>Creatives Coordinator</b> at <b>Techfest</b>. I used to participate in almost all competitions and workshops organized by the Finance Club. These included Finsearch, Equity Research, Investment Banking, and Algo Trading Competition

                        <p><b>Apping Process</b><br><br>
I started by making a database of all small-size firms and startups in the Finance Domain in Bombay. Then I sent out connection requests to all the employees from these firms on LinkedIn with a small introduction of mine. After that, I got two interviews and got selected for one of them.<br>The first step is easy, but after sending a connection request, it is challenging to create a loop as many people don’t respond. Other than that, my interview was just a simple HR Round which was more of a discussion of my resume, educational and family background. The main requirement is that you should be able to show them that you are enthusiastic about that field and are looking for some professional exposure.<br>To make the process more efficient, prepare an Excel sheet for the database and code it for various steps like Initial Message sent, Reminder to be sent, Loop created, etc</p>

                    <p><b>Takeaways from my internship</b><br><br>
Main takeaways include<br>
>Always have a data-driven research<br>
> Be punctual and accountable at work<br>
> Always respect everyone<br>
> Present your ideas clearly<br><br>
<b>Advice for the Sophomores</b><br><br>
If you really are excited about any field, then I would always recommend you to look for an offline internship for two months, but if you are not sure about your professional life then it is better to look for some remote project/intern as I feel I have missed those 2-3 months where I could have spent a memorable time with my family because maybe you won’t get this sort of time again with your family.</p>
