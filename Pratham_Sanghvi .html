<br><br><b> How did you decide on the specific role and company you wanted to apply for?
</b>
<br><br>
Deciding on a role and company was a process of elimination for me. After exploring core roles, I realized they didn’t align with my interests or goals, as I didn’t find them challenging or exciting enough. By my fourth year, I had clarity about my aspirations and knew I wanted to focus on consulting and finance, with long-term goals in investment or creation on the buy side. Roles like consulting, investment banking, private equity, and hedge funds stood out, and I tailored my resumes accordingly. My well-rounded resumes also allowed flexibility for roles like product management or CEO office positions
  <br><br>
<br><br><b> Was the domain you applied for during placements the same as the one you interned in during your third-year?  If not, why so</b>
<br><br>
 During my third-year internship at Piramal Pharma, I gained valuable experience and enjoyed a good work-life balance. However, I found the work insufficiently challenging and realized it didn’t align with my long-term career goals. This insight, gained during the two-month internship, helped me better understand my professional aspirations. Although I received a PPO offer, I declined it, choosing instead to pursue a more demanding path in investment banking or consulting. While these fields require intense commitment and long hours, I felt they offered the best route to achieving my career ambitions. <br><br>
<br><br><b>What were the shortlisting criteria for the company?
</b>
<br><br>
I targeted finance and consulting during placements and received several shortlists for both. Consulting shortlists were primarily resume-based, so I focused on crafting a strong resume that highlighted my achievements. For interviews, I prepared extensively with case studies and ensured I had a clear purpose for pursuing consulting. In finance, shortlisting depended more on aptitude tests (20–30% resume-based), but interviews required a strong finance background on the resume, which I lacked. While I had theoretical knowledge, I struggled to convey my purpose for pursuing finance, as I hadn’t built practical experience, like internships or stock market trading. Proper preparation and genuine interest in finance can greatly improve chances.

<br><br><br><br>
<b>What were the different rounds ?</b>
<br><br>
 During placements, I applied to several day-one companies, including A&M, where I was selected. A&M had a relatively large shortlist of 30–40 candidates, while Think Investments and other finance roles had smaller, more selective shortlists, with multiple interview rounds. At A&M, I went through three interview rounds: the first was a 20-minute verbal case and a general fit check; the second focused on my resume, work experience, and another verbal case; and the third was primarily HR-focused. In contrast, finance interviews typically began with an aptitude and basic finance round, followed by progressively deeper finance-focused interviews. For candidates without a finance background, the second round is the most challenging, while those with weaker interpersonal skills should focus on HR-heavy final rounds.
<br><br> <br><br><b>Are there any set of repetitive que or cases that you noticed especially in HR or GD?
</b>
<br><br>
A common feature of HR interviews is the repetition of certain questions, such as why you’re interested in the company or the chosen domain. If you’ve declined a PPO after a third-year internship, be prepared to explain your decision without sounding indecisive. Companies like P&G are known for their nuanced HR questions, often revolving around personal experiences. Examples include discussing a tough decision, meeting a hard deadline, or handling an uncomfortable situation. Reflecting on your past three to four years and identifying key experiences can help craft thoughtful responses to such scenarios.
<br>In case interviews, questions are usually based on real problems the interviewer has tackled, making them unpredictable. Practicing guesstimates, such as estimating how many balls can fit into a room, can sharpen your problem-solving approach. Group discussions, on the other hand, require clarity and collaboration, with a good understanding of the company’s values enhancing your performance. Success in these stages ultimately depends on thorough preparation and the ability to adapt quickly to diverse challenges.
<br><br><br><br>
<b>How did you prepare for each round?</b>
<br><br>
 When it comes to preparing for interviews, a structured approach is key. For HR questions and GDs, regular practice and reviewing every point on your resume are essential. Reflect on your past work and ensure you can articulate it well. If I were to prepare again, I’d dive deeper into finance theory, especially if your resume lacks strong finance-related experience. For finance roles, interviewers expect specialization, so it’s important to be thorough in your preparation.<br><br><br><br>
<b>What is your current exact role in the company, if we ask about a typical day in your life as the employee?</b>
<br><br>
Currently, I work as an Associate Consultant at A&M, handling commercial due diligence, strategy cases, and implementation projects. My typical day involves either working from the office or at the client’s site, depending on the project demands. Days often stretch long—sometimes until midnight or later—but we try to keep weekends free unless a case is especially demanding.
<br>
The work itself is dynamic and exciting. One day, you might strategize for an entire market; the next, you’re analyzing unit-level economics. It’s this balance of big-picture thinking and detailed problem-solving that keeps the job engaging. Beyond the work, the supportive culture and camaraderie make a huge difference. Even during intense 16-18 hour days, moments like playing table tennis, sharing meals, and joking around with colleagues create a homely, enjoyable environment
<br><br><br><br>
<b>Key learnings from the process and a final note for fourthies</b>
<br><br>
 One of the biggest lessons I learned during placements is the importance of keeping an open mind. To be honest, A&M was my fourth or fifth choice out of the five shortlist options I had. But after working here and hearing stories from friends at other companies, I’d now rank it second or third. This experience taught me that even if you have a clear idea of your preferences, you might not fully understand what’s best for you until you explore.
<br>
Placements also reinforce the belief that whatever happens, there’s always something good to take away from it. It’s easy to let one day or a few interviews feel defining, but life doesn’t work that way. There’s always a path to where you want to go. Whether you start in FMCG and pivot to finance or begin in finance and move to strategy, you’ll figure it out. So don’t overthink the process—stay open to opportunities, and trust that you’ll find your way.
