<br><br><b>  How did you decide on the specific role and company you wanted to apply for?
</b>
<br><br>
I was always inclined towards core engineering roles. My internships were in core domains, so during placements, I prioritized core jobs. While I had a slight interest in non-core roles like product management, consulting, or product analysis, I didn’t pursue them actively since my resume lacked relevant experiences.
  <br><br>
<br><br><b> Was the domain you applied for during placements the same as the one you interned in during your third year? If not, why?</b>
<br><br>
Yes, my third-year internship aligned with the domain I applied for. I interned at Colgate-Palmolive in Hiranandani as a research intern, which I secured through LinkedIn, not campus placements. My project involved studying the mouthfeel of toothpaste—how consumers perceive the feel while brushing. I researched toothpaste properties, created a correlation model, and estimated specific parameters to quantify the feel.
 <br><br>
<br><br><b> How crucial were the pre-placement talks (PPT), and would you recommend attending them?
</b>
<br><br>
Pre-placement talks (PPTs) weren’t particularly useful. Most attendees were there for freebies and snacks. Core companies, except BPCL, generally don’t conduct PPTs, and BPCL's sessions were only for shortlisted students, making them redundant. If a company aligns with your interest, attending their PPT might be beneficial. Otherwise, attending random PPTs just for placement points isn’t worth it. The talks mostly highlight the company’s achievements and briefly touch on the offered roles.


<br><br><br><br>
<b>What was the selection process like?</b>
<br><br>
The selection process had the following steps: <br>  <br>
1. Shortlisting: Based on CPI cut-offs and reservation criteria.<br><br>  
2. Forms: Shortlisted candidates filled two forms:<br><br>
   - Form A: Personal information.  <br>
   - Form B: Past experience, hobbies, etc. <br>  

   BPCL also used to select candidates through GATE, but for placements, the process was standardized.  
<br><br>
3. Technical Interview: A panel of 10–12 senior professionals (with 25–30 years of experience) conducted the technical round. Questions included:
   - Introduction.  
   - Topics like distillation columns, pumps, compressors, and why I chose Chemical Engineering and BPCL.  
<br><br>
4. HR Round and Psychometric Test: After the technical round, selected candidates proceeded to the HR round, which included a psychometric test to ensure honesty. Questions in HR often revolved around personal motivations, such as:  
   - Why Chemical Engineering?  
   - Why IIT Bombay?  
   - What excites you about BPCL?  
   - Who inspires you?  


<br><br> <br><br><b>Were there any repetitive questions or cases, especially in HR or group discussions?
</b>
<br><br>
Yes, HR often asked about higher studies intentions, as they are keen on retaining employees, particularly IIT graduates.

<br><br> <br><br><b>How did you prepare for each round?
</b>
<br><br>
1. Technical Preparation: 
   - In my seventh semester, I took a course on Chemical Equipment and Equipment Selection, which covered essential concepts about equipment, their uses, and varieties.  
   - I reached out to seniors and peers to understand common interview questions, especially about compressors and pumps.  
<br>
2. HR Preparation:
   - I ensured my answers were realistic and backed by past experiences to appear authentic.  

<br><br> <br><br><b> If you had to prepare all over again, what changes would you make?
</b>
<br><br>
I would focus solely on core preparation and avoid spending time on unrelated areas like consulting or product management. For instance, I practiced guesstimates extensively, which I now feel was unnecessary since I was better suited for core roles. Additionally, I would have concentrated more on identifying opportunities in core companies, given their limited presence.
<br><br> <br><br><b> What are the key learnings from the placement process?
</b>
<br><br>
- Don’t get discouraged—it’s a challenging process, and setbacks are part of it.  
- Persistence pays off. Even if things seem to go wrong, your efforts will eventually bear fruit.  
- Focus on your strengths and stay committed to your goals. 


<!-- <br><br> <br><br><b>Any tips for placement preparation?</b>
<br><br>
Start early and prepare steadily to avoid last-minute stress. Plan your preparation, especially for technical subjects, and trust in your efforts. Stress is natural, but with the right preparation, things will fall into place<b>How did you prepare for the placement process?</b>
<br><br> <br><br>
<b> If you had to redo your preparation, what would you do differently?</b>
<br><br>
Honestly, I wouldn’t change a thing. I prepared well and have no regrets about the process.    
<br><br> <br><br><b>What are your key learnings from the placement process, and do you have any advice for final-year students?</b>
<br><br>
Placement season is often the first time students face such intense pressure, and it can be very hectic. However, it pushes you to grow and teaches you resilience and time management. You’ll achieve in three months what you couldn’t in four years. Even if you don’t land your dream job, the experience will make you stronger and better prepared for future challenges. My advice to final-year students is to start early, plan effectively, and embrace the process. Trust that everything will work out in the end.  
<br><br> <br><br><b>Were there any repetitive questions in the HR or technical rounds?</b>
<br><br>
Yes, some questions are quite standard. In the HR round, they often ask about your strengths and weaknesses, your biggest achievements, and times when you took on a challenge. In the technical round, they focus on topics like pumps, distillation columns, heat transfer, and basic fluid mechanics concepts.

                        <p><b>	How was the shortlisting process ?</b>
                            The selection process typically involves an initial test and resume screening. Companies had specific CPI criteria and would shortlist students based on their CPI, relevant keywords in their resumes, or involvement in particular clubs.</p>

                                <b>Are there any set of repetitive que or cases that you noticed especially in HR or GD? </b><br>
The cases given during interviews were quite specific and not repetitive. However, in the HR round, the focus was primarily on introductions and resume screening.

                                <b>How did you prepare for each round? </b><br>
For tech preparation, I focused on DSA, some theory, and Machine Learning. For the HR round, I used a book with 64 common HR questions but only went through the first 15-20 pages. You don’t need to dive deep—going through 10-20 questions gives a good idea and helps you navigate the interview. For consulting prep, I practiced cases from books, and for product roles, I found the new books in the market less relevant. Watching a few YouTube videos was more helpful for that.

                                <b>If you have had to do your prep all over again, what changes would you do?</b><br>
I don’t think I would have changed much in my preparation—what I did was enough. I just wish I had been more confident and reassured myself that I would get placed, even if it took some time. I should have stayed more positive, knowing that something would eventually work out and I would secure a placement.

                            <p><b>	Key learnings from the process and a final note for fourthies.</b><br>
                                A key learning I’d share with all final-year students is to be more patient. The shortlisting process can feel very random—sometimes people who may not seem deserving get placed. But in the end, you need to have confidence and patience, trusting that you will get placed. Just keep trying every day, and things will eventually work out.
