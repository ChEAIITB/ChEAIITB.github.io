                        <p>Hi, I am <b>Krina Gami</b>, a third-year UG student pursuing a major in Chemical Engineering at IIT Bombay. I hail from Mumbai. I'm also diving into Management Operations as a minor.<br>I was a part of the advisory domain, focusing on risk advisory at PwC. <b>PwC</b> is a consulting firm. They cover a wide range of services, from management consulting and legal expertise to taxation, corporate finance, and, of course, advisory services like the one I was involved in. <br><br>
                        <b>Work Experience</b><br><br>
During my time at work, I was fortunate to be a part of a small, dedicated team. My primary mentor, along with one of her colleagues, guided me through our project. Together, we collaborated on developing a business model, and we later had the opportunity to present it to our clients.<br>One aspect that made my experience particularly enjoyable was having a buddy on the team. She was incredibly helpful and patient, especially considering that I was an intern at a learning stage.<br>
  My internship primarily involved working from home, which provided me with a high degree of flexibility in terms of managing my work schedule. Although there were a few tight deadlines to meet, I had the freedom to organize my tasks according to my own timelines. This flexibility allowed me to balance my work efficiently and contributed to a positive overall work experience.<br><br>
<b>My Sophomore Year...</b><br><br>When it came to my summer plans, I didn't have a laser-focused goal in mind nor did I initially set my sights on risk advisory. It just happened to be the opportunity that I came across while applying. I simply knew that I wanted to get a taste of the consulting culture and started searching for suitable opportunities. My management operations minor didn't align with the domain either, but I was eager to explore and learn, so I went for it.
<br>
Back in my sophomore year, I was a Finance Club convener. This experience turned out to be a big asset during my interviews, especially because I was a chemical engineer applying for a consulting role. It seemed that the interviewers weren't quite aware of the diverse, non-core culture at IIT, and were a little confused as to why would I choose such a role, so my position really helped me showcase my passion for non-core activities.<br>During the interviews, I went into detail about how we operated in the finance club and the positive impact it had on our institute. I believe this not only piqued their interest but also made them realize the broader skill set and interests that I brought to the table.</p>

                        <p><b>Apping Process</b><br><br>
First things first, identify your interests within the professional domain you're looking to enter. Chat with senior peers who have experience in this field. They can provide valuable insights and recommendations.</p>
                    </div>
                <div class="blog-c2">
                    <p><b>Building Your Company Database:</b><br><br>
Now, let's talk about creating your own list of target companies. You can start by asking your seniors if they have a database of companies that you can use. This will save you some research time. Once you have your list, narrow it down to those that truly pique your interest.To find contacts at these companies, go to their websites. Look for any leads or contacts. Check out the LinkedIn profiles of the company's employees, especially those in roles you're interested in. You can even use handy Chrome extensions like "Adapt" to find their emails on LinkedIn.<br><br>
<b>Crafting Your Cover Email:</b><br><br>
Next up, is the cover email. Keep it concise and engaging. Start by introducing yourself, and mentioning your affiliation with IITB. Then, explain why you're keen on joining that specific company, what you're looking to learn or contribute, and how your skills or previous positions of responsibility (PORs) make you a great fit. Remember to include a link to your CV. Most importantly, personalize each email to the recipient.
Before hitting "send," it's a great idea to have your cover email reviewed by your seniors for their feedback and suggestions.<br><br>
<b>LinkedIn Connection Message:</b><br><br>When sending connection requests on LinkedIn, remember to keep your message within the 300-character limit. Be direct and to the point. Once they accept your request, you can send them your cover email. Aim to connect with at least 10 employees from each company you're targeting.<br><br>
<b>After Sending the Email:</b><br><br>If you receive no reply after a week, consider sending a short reminder email. But don't overdo it; limit reminders to 2-3. For negative replies, always thank them for their time and consideration. Express your interest in future opportunities and assure them you'll stay in touch.
When you receive a positive reply, take the opportunity to set up a meeting to discuss internship details and logistics. Use this time to clarify any doubts you have about the domain or formal interview processes. It's a great chance to establish a deeper connection.<br><br>
<b>Logistics</b><br><br>I reside in Mumbai, and my internship posting was conveniently located within the city as well. The Goregaon office was quite close to my house, making my daily commute hassle-free. I usually commuted to the office by taking the metro or occasionally opted for an auto-rickshaw, depending on my preference and the traffic conditions.
<br><br><b>End Note</b><br><br>Key takeaways from my internship included improved time management, exposure to the corporate world, and the opportunity to build a valuable professional network.
